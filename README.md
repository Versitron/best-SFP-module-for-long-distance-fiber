## LC vs SC for 10G Fiber Module

When choosing between LC and SC connectors for 10G fiber modules, LC is the industry standard due to its smaller footprint and support for higher port densities. SC connectors, while robust, are bulkier and less common in 10G equipment.

Most modern 10G SFP modulesâ€”including those from Versitronâ€”use duplex LC interfaces to facilitate more compact switch layouts, allowing for greater scalability in high-performance environments.
